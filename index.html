      <p>My name is Joshua R. Tugi!</p>
      <p>
        I'm a passionate IT student, with a deep interest in coding, design, and writing. This website shares my story from childhood to future dreams.

      <p>
        I grew up in Nairobi, Kenya, specifically in Umoja Phase One. I was surrounded by family and friends who always encouraged me to pursue my dreams.
         My childhood was filled with curiosity, creativity, and a love for technology. From an early age, I enjoyed exploring computers and learning how things work. I also loved football at a very young age, playing with my friends in the neighborhood and dreaming of becoming a professional player one day.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I progressed through school, my interest in IT grew stronger. I dedicated myself to learning new programming languages like HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and others, building websites, and collaborating on projects with classmates. These experiences shaped my skills and inspired me to aim higher.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, I am focused on expanding my knowledge in software development, design, and digital storytelling. My goal is to use technology to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact.
